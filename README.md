# Saturation analysis

Analysis of saturation on activation values as described in:

> Glorot, X. and Bengio, Y. (2010). Understanding the difficulty of training deep feedforward neural networks. Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pages 249-256.

The analysis are made for different activation functions and results are further discussed in [post](https://artur-deluca.github.io/post/saturation/).
